    <h4>
        The definition of art is open, subjective, debatable. 
        There is no agreement among historians and artists, which is why weâ€™re left with so
         many definitions of art. The concept itself has changed over centuries.

The very notion of art continues today to stir controversy, 
being so open to multiple interpretations. It can be taken simply 
to mean any human activity, or any set of rules needed to develop an activity.
 This would generalize the concept beyond what is normally understood as the fine arts, now broadened to 
 encompass academic areas. The word has many other colloquial uses, too.
